Spam Classification in Emails based on Support Vector Machines
======================================================
### Intro
Many email services today provide spam filters that are able to classify emails into spam and non-spam email with high accuracy.The project is to develop a __support vector machine__ using a __Gaussian kernel__ capable of performing such a task.   </br>
The project was done as a part of [Stanford ML Course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
### Overview
The project consists of 3 datasets .The first dataset uses basic __linear__ decision boundary where the __C value__ is constant. The second dataset involves using a Gaussian kernel which is based on __linearly inseparable dataset__.The 3rd dataset is more advance once requiring the use of both.
